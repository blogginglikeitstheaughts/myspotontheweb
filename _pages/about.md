Hi! High-masking ADHDer here. I've got my own technical writing business, and am also trained in the Alexander Technique, a mind-body technique for reducing unecessary tense postural habits. 
Currently into biking (just barely making a bike-based lifestyle work with USA road infrastructure), landscaping and gardening in the high desert, popular science books, graphic novels, scifi/fantasy, and textile arts. I speak German and Dutch. I'm a resilient career chameleon (I was a graduate-level classical musician, an academic freelance editor, and trade book ghostwriter and copyeditor, among other roles).
