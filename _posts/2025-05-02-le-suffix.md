Recently I shared a social media post with my mom about the suffix `le`:

Inspired, she consulted the OED and found a bunch more meanings. Then she wrote this fun story for my kids. DC1 (in kindergarten) filled in the missing l's, and we read it aloud with and without the `le`s.
As an aside, when they got to the line

> The man pointed his corac_e away from the island

DC2 said, "Nana, you can't point a coracle!"So true! (They knew because we'd recently read a funny chapter concerning a horrible coracle ride in a Daniel Pinkwater book).


> A tru(ffl)e story
> Under a sky full of twink_ing stars, a man grabbed his fishing pole and wrigg_ed into his corac_e. Moonbeams spark_ed on the water, and the breeze ruff_ed his hair. The boat was easy to hand_e; he padd_ed nimb_y toward the island. On the island, a gagg_e of geese was sleeping, their heads nest_ed under their wings. One gabb_ed softly in its sleep.
> Something rust_ed and shuff_ed in the underbrush – the man’s spine ting_ed. Was this the famous snagg_e-toothed boar that could nuzz_e his snout into the earth and snuff_e out truff_es? Though many had tried, no one had ever been able to wrang_e this beast off the island. The man had a plan: he dang_ed a small bund_e of truff_es from his fishing pole. The beast came closer and closer, sniffing the air. The man pointed his corac_e away from the island, toward the shore, and padd_ed slowly. The pig crink_ed his eyes shut, wrink_ed his snout, followed the truff_e scent, and soon, he was swimming.
> When the corac_e reached the shore, the man jumped out and lured the boar into a large pen. “Here, Pigg_e, Pigg_e, Pigg_e . . .” This was his plan: He and the snagg_e-toothed boar would hunt truff_es together. He would pedd_e the truff_es, and  make a bood_e of money. He and the boar would go back to the island whenever they needed a break. He’d take a duff_e bag full of waff_es and truff_es in the corac_e, and they would romp and feast with the gagg_e of geese.
> Would the plan work? It was worth a gamb_e.
