title: "Designed  new dress"

I designed, sewed, and dyed a new dress! It's a princess seamed, half-length sleeve.

The dye was procion warm black and deep yellow, I used low-water immersion (the 'bread bag' method) in a triple-bagged gallon bag in my slow cooker on warm.

As always, I took satisfaction in my slapdash, invented finishing techniques. for example, the neckline is stabilized with a piece of string, which I just elmer-glued to the fabric, then sewed in. It looks a lil sloppy close up, but it's real strong and stable!
