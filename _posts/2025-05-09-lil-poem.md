My kid (age almost-9) came up with a nursery rhyme which I think(?) is original? At least I can't find anything like it on a quick google. It's a choosing game, like eenie meenie miney mo:

> China and Italy,
> 
> Harold and Mary,
> 
> I choose you to
> 
> be the queen fairy!

If they actually made it up, I'm quite impressed. It has the ring of a hundreds-year-old English nursey rhyme to me.
