"title": "Working on native relandscaping the backyard"

So excited to have made progress! I really, really love the heavy labor of moving soil, now I own a digging bar and mattock that is. Before that, gardening was impossible with our desert hardpan. With the right tools, I feel powerful and empowered.

Here's what I did:

- moved 1.5 cubic yard of topsoil
- regraded a slope using a yard-long level and a stiff piece of cardboard as an extention
- laid down preliminary stonework for paths, and adjusted paths. will bark mulch them in future
- tilled and weeded with a lil 1-ft long mattock, squatting to do so, because I'm my own eccentric person and I have to do things my way, apparently
- seeded a native grass mix and wildflowers
- set up automated above-ground irrigation (out-of-sight, out-of-mind is a real problem for me, so I'm increasingly leaning toward above ground. Better wasting water on a little evaporation than on hidden, underground leaks!)

  To be capable of this heavy manual labor without chronic joint pain feels like a supreme triumph. Go me! 


Here's a shot of some of the newly seeded areas (the grasses in the middle represent last year's test plot)
