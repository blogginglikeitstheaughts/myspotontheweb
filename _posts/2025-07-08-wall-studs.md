title: Finding wall studs with a sewing pin
---

Our urrent house has the most difficult-to-find wall studs I've ever encountered. Something to do with the heavily textured paint perhaps? Recently I tried using two stud finders -- one cheap, one fancy -- and STILL ended up drilling 5(!) unsuccessful holes before I found a stud, more or less by luck!

Enough already!

I found an extremely clever solution: I hammer a sturdy sewing pin into the wall with a small hammer. If it goes in all the way, there's no stud. If it stops halfway in, there's a stud. The pinprick holes it leaves behind are virtually invisible.
Yay!

By the way, I use the hammer-in-a-sewing pin solution to hang all sorts of lightweight art on my walls, up to and including my larger art quilts! So flexible and fun. My mom tipped me on to that approach. Dollar store frames are perfect for this approach cause they're super lightweight.  here's the backside of a frame to give you an idea.
